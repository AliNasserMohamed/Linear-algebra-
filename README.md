this project is conserned mainly to applying main linear algebra concepts with numpy , pandas and matplotlib 
the project has 3 main notbooks 
## 1- AI Vectors and Matrices operations
### this notbook study the following 
1- Find a solution for systems of equations using numpy 

2- Dot Product and vector Norm 

3- see if system of linear equations has solution or not 

## 2- vector Space and Gram Shmidt.
### this notbook study the following 
1- Vector Span

2- Linear Transformation

3- Determinant

4-Matrix Rank

5-Vector Linear Independence

6-Gramâ€“Schmidt Process (Orthogonalization)

## 3- Eigenvectors, Eigenvalues, Diagonalization, PCA, and SVD

### this notbook study the following

1-Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues

2-PCA Using Eigen Decomposition

3-caluculate SVD manually

4-Apply the SVD on images
